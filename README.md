# FireDronesRL

FireDronesRL is a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) project where multiple agents (drones) are trained to manage wildfire in a 2D grid forest. Drones compete and collaborate to extinguish fire quickly.

## Requirements

This project uses the following libraries:

-   RLlib (add hyperlink)
-   Gymnasium (add hyperlink)

## Installation

## How to Run

(insert instruction)

### Files

`environment.py`: Defines the wildfire model environment

## Results

## Extending the Project

Here are some additional considerations that can be incoorporated to create more realistic dynamics:

-   Total amount of water each drone can spray is less than or equal to its water capacity
-   Drones must replenish its battery and water
-   Ensure safety distance between fire and drones
-   Add environmental factors (e.g. wind affects fire spread direction)
